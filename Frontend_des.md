## Cross-Frontend Architecture & Integration

### **Application Integration Flow**
The system follows a hub-and-spoke architecture where the Main Administrative Frontend serves as the central orchestration point:

#### **Authentication & Routing Flow**
1. **Entry Point**: All users start at `src/components/LoginPage.tsx`
2. **Role-Based Routing**: LoginPage determines user role and routes to appropriate frontend:
   - **Admin**: Remains in main application with full system access
   - **DVLA Officer**: Redirected to DVLA frontend via component mounting
   - **Police Officer**: Redirected to Police frontend with Supabase authentication
   - **Supervisor**: Redirected to Supervisor frontend with route-based navigation
3. **Session Management**: Mixed authentication strategy:
   - Main app uses custom AuthContext with sessionManager utilities
   - Police/Supervisor use Supabase authentication
   - DVLA inherits authentication from main app mounting

#### **Data Flow & Lifecycle**
The complete violation lifecycle demonstrates cross-frontend integration:

1. **Detection Phase (Police)**:
   - Officer uses VehicleScanner to detect plates via OpenCV
   - VehicleInformationAccess queries unified API for vehicle data
   - ViolationFlagging creates violation record with evidence

2. **Review Phase (Supervisor)**:
   - PendingViolations page shows police submissions
   - ViolationDetailsModal provides detailed evidence review
   - Supervisor Accept/Reject decisions update unified database

3. **Processing Phase (DVLA)**:
   - Accepted violations trigger fine records in DVLA system
   - ClearFines component handles payment processing
   - VehicleRecords updated with violation history

4. **Administration Phase (Main)**:
   - ViolationTable provides system-wide violation overview
   - AnalyticsReporting generates cross-system insights
   - AuditLogViewer tracks all system activities

### **Shared Technical Infrastructure**

#### **API Integration**
- **Unified API Client**: `src/lib/unified-api.ts` provides consistent backend interface
- **Supabase Integration**: `src/lib/supabase.ts` for real-time updates and authentication
- **Individual API Clients**: Each frontend maintains specialized API functions
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Mock data and offline capabilities for development

#### **State Management Patterns**
